## Objective:
- Optimize the user's response to a down-shift and up-shift command.
- Maintain strict practices and edge cases for critical safety.
- Build the first fully-fledged DAQ with re-usable code through:
    - The Layered Architecture design pattern
    - Modularity of components
    - Hardware abstraction

## Hardware and Equipment
### Target Device
The [STM32 Nucleo F466RE](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f446re.html) microcontroller development board is used as the current target device for code merged to the `main` and `develop` branches. Theoretically, other Arm Cortex M4 based STM32 devices with the necessary peripherals should be able to run the same program.

## Firmware Tech Stack
- STM32 Hardware Abstraction Layer ([HAL](https://www.st.com/resource/en/user_manual/um1725-description-of-stm32f4-hal-and-lowlayer-drivers-stmicroelectronics.pdf))
  - Generated by STM32CubeMX within the CubeIDE environment, which also provides the `arm-none-eabi` toolchain.
  - Serves as a set of drivers or a Board Support Package (BSP) to interface with the microcontroller.

## Automation
- Unit tests are developed using [Google Test](https://google.github.io/googletest/) and are maintained in `Shifter_System/Tests`.
- See our [Unit Testing page](https://github.com/DallasFormulaRacing/DataAcquisition2.0/wiki/Unit-Testing) for running them locally by leveraging [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/).
- Continuous Integration (CI)
  - The firmware is compiled as an stm32CubeIDE project using the following GitHub Action: [xanderhendriks/action-build-stm32cubeide](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/build-stm32cubeide-project).
  - The unit tests are compiled and ran using [CMake](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/index.html) with [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/manual.html).
